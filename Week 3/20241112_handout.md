## Question 1

## Question 2

## Question 3

For a matrix $m\times n$ matrix $A$, $\operatorname{rank}(A)\le\min(m,n)$.

## Question 4

First, for there to be only one solution. The system must be full rank.

Then, it must be square or skinny. Because there cannot be free variables.

## Question 5

Augment that hoe into a matrix $A$ and find $\operatorname{rref}(A)$. If full rank, the vectors are linearly independent. Else, no.

## Question 6
